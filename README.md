# Pull Request App

##### *NOTE: text is whited out for privacy reasons.*

## Challenge
> Up till now, there could be a better way to help the engineering team with their GitHub pull requests. When making pull requests or PR on GitHub, you are letting others know the changes you made on a project. This project helps with efficiency and PR organization.

## Solution
> The solution was to create a web app that uses GitHub integration. The process, in brief, goes from brainstorming what the app would look like, technology research (Typescript, React, API, etc.), design, minimum viable product (MVP), fixing bugs, refining, and testing.
